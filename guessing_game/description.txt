This is a simple number guessing game.

The program will pick a random whole number between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and you, the player, will try to guess what it is.
You have a limited number of attempts, typically 10.
After each guess, the program will tell you if your guess was 'Too high!' or 'Too low!'.
The game ends when you guess the correct number or you run out of attempts.
The goal is to guess the number in as few tries as possible!
