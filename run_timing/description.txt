Challenge: Create a function run_timing() that calculates the average time for your 10 km runs.

Requirements:
    1. The function prompts the user to enter the time (in minutes) for each 10 km run.
    2. It continues prompting until the user presses Enter without entering a value.
    3. After the user presses Enter, the function calculates and displays the average run time and the number of runs.
    4. All numeric inputs and the average should be floating-point values.

Enter 10 km run time: 15
Enter 10 km run time: 20
Enter 10 km run time: 10
Enter 10 km run time: <enter>
Average of 15.0, over 3 runs


Focus: Data accumulation, type conversion (string to float), and calculating statistics.
